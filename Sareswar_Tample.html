       <p>These twin temples are dedicated to Mahadev and located in the village of Dihar which is 8 km distant from Bishnupur. You will see a Nandi Bull seated at the entrance of the Sareswar Temple as if it is protecting it. These temples, made of laterite stone, are majestic examples of Oriya Deul style architecture. This place becomes a pilgrimage during ‘Mahashivratri’ festival and ‘Gajan’.
