       <p>Rasmancha, the oldest brick temple was established by the King Hambir in 1600 AD.
         The majestic temple is architecturally so unique and unparalleled that it is one 
         of its kind in the whole Bengal as well as the country. Rasmancha proudly stands 
        on a laterite plinth and owns a single chamber neighbouring hut shaped turrets 
        along with an elongated tower. You will get to witness a heritage that is enthroned 
        with a pyramidal superstructure and is blessed with three circumbulatory galleries, 
        tranquil pillars and mysterious arches with terracotta lotus motif. In the presence 
        of daylight, when you will be walking through the galleries, you will feel history 
        whispering in your ears by the language of light and shade. In the dark, glowing 
        lights from the monument makes a thrilling ambience.
