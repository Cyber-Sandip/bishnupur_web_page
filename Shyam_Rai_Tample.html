       <p>The temple was built by King Raghunath Singh in 1643, is popularly known as ‘Panch-chura’ temple as it owns five pinnacles. The temple looks beautiful with triple arched passage on its four sides. It is one of the star attractions of Bishnupur because of its breathtaking terracotta art-forms on both interior and exterior panels. Various scenes based on religious stories like ‘Indra fighting sitting on Oirabot’, ‘Saga of Ram and Raban’,’Glimpses of Krishna Lila’, ‘love of Radha-Krishna’, ‘Hunting scenarios from old society’ etc. are truly representing the terracotta art at its best. Another attraction of this temple is a giant Raschakra that depicts various forms of ‘Radha-Krishna Lila amidst of Gopinis’.
